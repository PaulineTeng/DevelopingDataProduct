## What do the blood pressure numbers mean?

Blood pressure is typically recorded as two numbers:
  1. Systolic - The higher number, measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats

  2. Diastolic - The lower number, measures the pressure in the arteries between heart beats

## Hypertension Prediction

The prediction is based on two numbers given, Systolic and Diastolic.

The predicted result could be
  - Normal
  - Prehypertension
  - Hypertension

---

## Example

  Systolic = 125
  
  Diastolic = 89
